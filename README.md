# Table Tennis Championship Manager
This project uses SQL and PL/SQL and is useful for making connections between participants, 
their age categories, referees, and the prizes available. There are several tournaments each month, 
but not on the same day, so that each participant can play in all tournaments or be a spectator at them, 
in case they cannot play or do not belong to the tournament category.
